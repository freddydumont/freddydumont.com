excerpt: Use Gatsby's Node API to process images in JSON files with gatsby-plugin-sharp and customize the shape of your data in GraphQL nodes.
---

When I started building the portfolio section of my personal site, I encountered a small problem.

I was building cards that contained both data and image and I wanted everything to appear under the same GraphQL node. Turns out there's no way for Gatsby to recognize a path to an image in a JSON file by default.

Additionally, I needed to do some processing on the tag data before it could be usable so I started searching for a solution that would handle both cases.

## The problem

I wanted to achieve two things:

1. Process the tag array and turn it into a usable array of objects
2. Have Sharp process the image and get the resulting node in the same tree

My first reflex was to go for [`gatsby-transformer-json`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-json/), but I quickly realized that this transformer wouldn't understand that I had image paths in my data, much less process them using Sharp.

On top of it, I couldn't preprocess my tag array nor give a specific shape to my `PortfolioCard` node.

Back to the docs. I knew that I needed to source images from the filesystem so I started there. The [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/working-with-images/) was helpful in that regard.

I recommend you have a read if you've never done this, but here's a summary of what you need to do:

1. Install the following plugins with yarn:

   ```shell
   yarn add gatsby-image gatsby-source-filesystem gatsby-plugin-sharp gatsby-transformer-sharp
   ```

   or using `npm`:

   ```shell
   npm install gatsby-image gatsby-source-filesystem gatsby-plugin-sharp gatsby-transformer-sharp
   ```

2. Add the plugins to your `gatsby-config.js`:

```javascript {6,7,9}
const path = require(`path`);

module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `images`,
        // provide the path to your image folder here:
        path: path.join(__dirname, `src`, `assets`),
      },
    },
    ...
  ],
};
```

Now if you go to your GraphiQL IDE (by default Gatsby serves it on http://localhost:8000/___graphql) you'll see an `allImageSharp` field which you can use to query your images processed by Sharp.

That's great, but not exactly what I wanted.

These image nodes should appear under the corresponding `PortfolioCard` tree with the rest of the associated data. Not on a top-level node that I would have to query separately using the name of the image obtained in a previous query.

## The solution

With some research, I ended up on [`sourceNodes` in the Gatsby Node APIs docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/#sourceNodes).

I understood that using this API, I could grab data from the filesystem, transform it and build a node in the shape that suited my needs.

Here's the result of my work in a step-by-step format. I'll be using code examples from my own website so feel free to browse the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/freddydumont/freddydumont.com/blob/master/gatsby-node.js) should you need to.

### Sourcing the data

The first thing we need to do is to get the JSON data in the `gatsby-node.js` file.

If we were to write a plugin handling a number of use cases, we'd need to read from the filesystem using Node to source the data. But because we're targeting a specific use case, hard coding the paths to our JSON files is the simplest thing to do:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const portfolio = require('./src/data/portfolio.json');
const colors = require('./src/data/tag_colors.json');

// relative path from `gatsby-node.js`
const IMAGE_PATH = './src/assets/';
```

For reference, here's `portfolio.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "NessIA.ca",
    "category": "Business website",
    "description": "Built for a client operating in the Business Intelligence space...",
    "technology": "The tool of choice these days for blazing fast websites is Gatsby...",
    "link": "https://nessia.ca/en",
    "image": "nessia.png",
    "alt": "NessIA homepage",
    "tags": ["javascript", "react", "gatsby", "bulma"]
  },
  ...
]
```

and `tag_colors.json`:

```json
{
  "javascript": "bg-yellow-vivid-400 text-gray-900",
  "react": "bg-blue-400 text-gray-900",
  "gatsby": "bg-purple-700 text-purple-100",
  ...
}
```

Now that we have access to our data, we need to build a node by adapting the [code example from the docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/#sourceNodes) to fit our objects.

In this example, we need to iterate over an array and build a node for each portfolio card, so all our code will be written inside a `forEach` loop:

```javascript {23,25}
exports.sourceNodes = ({ actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest }) => {
  portfolio.forEach((card) => {
    // 1. Extract the card data.
    const {
      title,
      category,
      description,
      technology,
      link,
      image,
      alt,
      tags,
    } = card;

    // 2. Build the PortfolioCard node. Note that most fields simply correspond to
    //    to our JSON data.
    const node = {
      title,
      category,
      description,
      technology,
      link,
      image, // <----- Problem here
      alt,
      tags, // <------ and here
      id: createNodeId(`card-${title}`),
      internal: {
        type: 'PortfolioCard',
        contentDigest: createContentDigest(card),
      },
    };

    // 3. Create the node
    actions.createNode(node);
  });
};
```

That's a good start. Our data now exists in a top-level node called `allPortfolioCard`. But what happens if we query it?

```graphql {7,9}
query {
  allPortfolioCard {
    nodes {
      alt
      category
      description
      image
      link
      tags
      technology
      title
    }
  }
}
```

As expected, we have a couple of issues. Both `image` and `tags` need to be processed before they can be usable.

```json {9,11}
{
  "data": {
    "allPortfolioCard": {
      "nodes": [
        {
          "alt": "NessIA homepage",
          "category": "Business website",
          "description": "Built for a client operating in the Business Intelligence space...",
          "image": "nessia.png",
          "link": "https://nessia.ca/en",
          "tags": ["javascript", "react", "gatsby", "bulma"],
          "technology": "The tool of choice these days for blazing fast websites is Gatsby...",
          "title": "NessIA.ca"
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Let's start with our `tags` array.

### Processing JSON data

Right now, we have an array of strings that needs to be transformed into an array of objects with the properties `name` and `color`:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "javascript",
    "color": "bg-yellow-vivid-400 text-gray-900"
  },
  ...
]
```

This is a fairly simple fix. We have the color data already imported in our `gatsby-node.js` file. All we need to do is to `map` over the tag array when building our node and return an object:

```javascript {9-12}
const colors = require('./src/data/tag_colors.json');

exports.sourceNodes = ({ actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest }) => {
  portfolio.forEach((card) => {
    // ...

    const node = {
      // ...
      tags: tags.map((name) => ({
        name,
        color: colors[name],
      })),
      // ...
    };

    actions.createNode(node);
  });
};
```

The following query will now be possible:

```graphql
query {
  allPortfolioCard {
    nodes {
      tags {
        color
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And will return the following data:

```json {8,9}
{
  "data": {
    "allPortfolioCard": {
      "nodes": [
        {
          "tags": [
            {
              "color": "bg-yellow-vivid-400 text-gray-900",
              "name": "javascript"
            },
            {
              "color": "bg-blue-400 text-gray-900",
              "name": "react"
            }
            // ...
          ]
        }
        // ...
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see, when building a custom node, we can do whatever we want with the data. We can pass it down as it is or transform it into a desired shape.

But what about the image field?

### Transforming an image path into a childImageSharp node

Now that's the tricky part.

It took a bit of digging, but I learned from [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56012718) that in order for Sharp to transform an image, it needs to be a `File` node.

So all we need to do is to create such a node by giving it the required fields.

> `gatsby-transformer-sharp` only checks if a node has the field 'extension' and -- if it is one of the valid file types -- processes it.

The whole answer is worth reading to deepen your understanding of how Gatsby operates under the hood. Let's go ahead and implement it.

```javascript {5,9,17,27,28,33,34}
exports.sourceNodes = ({ actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest }) => {
  portfolio.forEach((card) => {
    // ...

    // 1. name, extension and absolute path are required to build a File node
    const { name, ext } = path.parse(image);
    const absolutePath = path.resolve(__dirname, IMAGE_PATH, image);

    // 2. Build a data shape that corresponds to a File node that Sharp can process
    const data = {
      name,
      ext,
      absolutePath, // <-- required
      extension: ext.substring(1), // <-- required, remove the dot in `ext`
    };

    // 3. Build the image node using our data
    const imageNode = {
      ...data,
      id: createNodeId(`card-image-${name}`),
      internal: {
        type: 'PortfolioCardImage',
        contentDigest: createContentDigest(data),
      },
    };

    // 4. Create the node. When imageNode is created,
    //    Sharp adds childImageSharp to the node
    actions.createNode(imageNode);

    const node = {
      // ...
      // 5. Add the image node to our tree
      image: imageNode,
      // ...
    };

    actions.createNode(node);
  });
};
```

Now when you go back to your Graph Explorer, your should see a `childImageSharp` node under the `image` field.

You can then query for it and use it in conjunction with `gatsby-image`.

Here's what the final query looks like:

```graphql
query {
  allPortfolioCard {
    nodes {
      image {
        childImageSharp {
          fluid(maxWidth: 384) {
            ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid_tracedSVG
          }
        }
      }
      alt
      category
      description
      technology
      link
      tags {
        color
        name
      }
      title
    }
  }
}
```

Gatsby is pretty powerful out of the box, and even more once you start understanding how it works. I'm still barely scratching the surface but the more I play with it, the more I'm amazed with what it can do.

The key takeaway here is that whether you need to process your data before sending it to your GraphQL tree, or you need images processed by `gatsby-plugin-sharp` under a specific node, using the `sourceNodes` API in conjunction with the `createNode` action will help you achieve your goals.
